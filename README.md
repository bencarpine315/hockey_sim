Not a terribly advanced or in-depth simulator but realistic and fun to toy around with.
XLSX file will eventually be hundreds (if not thousands) of players long. It is important to have it in the same working directory when testing file, otherwise
there will be no dataframe to pull anything from.
This project is a MASSIVE work in progress. I want to eventually be able to simulate entire seasons.
My knowledge of Python is rudimentiary but I think this is a cool, Monte Carlo-esque way of
applying my love of sports to coding and frankly there's no other way I wanna do it.

Thanks for reading! I will be updating the files frequently.
